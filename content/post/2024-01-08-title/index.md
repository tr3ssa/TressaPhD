**I. Introduction**
Hello! If you're reading this, thank you so much for showing interest in my blog so early on in my career. I am writing this first post as a little introduction to myself, my research interests, and what is to come. My social medias are also linked at the top of my site, so if you want to follow along on my journey I invite you to do so! :)

**II. Who Even Am I?**
As I am writing this, I am an undergraduate Junior at Quinnipiac University (20 years old). I finally drafted this website during my J-term when I had time after thinking about it for months. My major is Behavioral Neuroscience, which is currently also my favorite branch of neuroscience research.
In my free time, I love to read! I'm currently reading the "ACOTAR" series by SJM. If you're a fantasy lover, you're probably familiar with this series. When I need an escape after a long day at the lab or in class, a good book is always a great escape.

**III. My Research Interests***
Currently, I work in my school's Behavioral Neuroscience Labs. Our experiments mostly revolve around motivation and behavior by comparing disease states to control states. More information to come in future posts!

I have a passion for using science to explain behavior, and always have. I started college as a psychology major, because that's what I thought the study of behavior was all about. Turns out, there is a whole world of neuroscience with so many niches to be discovered! After taking my current PI's physiopsychology class, I was immediately pulled towards the neuroscience major, as it is more natural science focused. Many psychology classes at my university focus more on the social work end-goal skills and knowledge, due to their MSW program.

I have interests in neuropharmacology and neurobiology at the moment. Understanding drug actions and how chemicals can dictate one's behavior fascinate me. I plan to write a lot of posts focusing on how the tiny chemicals floating around in your head can change the course of your life and your actions. My favorite takeaways from neuroscience courses are always the facts that can be applied to daily life!

**IV. My Future**
From the moment I entered college, I knew I would pursue a terminal degree. MD, PsyD, PhD? I didn't know. But I knew that whatever field I immersed myself in, I wanted to go all the way and study everything about the topic(s) that I love. After doing a lot of research into career paths, I realized that a PhD is my end goal and dream. The idea that I can spend my graduate school years studying one area that I am absolutely passionate about, and earn my degree as a result of my efforts, is everything I could ever want. I love research, designing experiments, and gathering results. After research projects, lab classes, an internship, and extensive Googling, I know that a PhD is the right path for me.

**V. Conclusion**
I want to thank you again, whoever you are, for showing interest in my blog. I am no one but a passionate undergraduate student at the moment, with no motivation to post other than my genuine love for science and sharing knowledge. If you ever want to chat feel free to reach out on one of my social media platforms, and I would be more than happy to engage about some nerdy stuff. :)
